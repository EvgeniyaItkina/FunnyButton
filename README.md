# FunnyButton Game
FunnyButton is a small interactive game where the button "runs away" from the user's cursor. If the user manages to click the button, a congratulatory message "You win!" appears along with a button to restart the game.


📋 *Features*

- **Custom styles:** The button changes shape, color, and text dynamically.
- **Traces**: A temporary trace appears where the button was previously located.
- **Winning screen**: Displays a congratulatory popup with a "Start New Game" button when the user clicks the button.
